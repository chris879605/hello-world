Learning how to use github
My name is Chris and I am learning how to use Python on EdX. Took Python 4 Everyone with Chuck Severance and now taking some IBM courses to analyze data. I am not a professional programmer but just want to learn how programming works. My day job is in trucking and truck leasing.
